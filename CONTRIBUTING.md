# Contributing to IdleForge RPG Engine

Thanks for helping improve IdleForge RPG Engine.

## Project Goals

- Keep the repo a lightweight browser RPG engine starter.
- Keep the demo working at all times.
- Keep engine code generic.
- Keep content files separate from engine logic.
- Keep the project understandable for beginners.

## Coding Style

- Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
- Prefer small, readable changes over large rewrites.
- Keep names generic in engine files.
- Keep formatting consistent with the surrounding code.
- Add comments only when a section would otherwise be hard to follow.

## Keep Engine Generic

Engine files should not contain theme-specific lore, names, or story text.

Good engine code handles:

- state
- combat
- inventory
- loot
- saving
- rendering

## Keep Demo Content Separate

Put demo-specific data in `js/content/` instead of engine files.

- `game.config.js` for theme settings
- `items.js` for equipment and sellable items
- `enemies.js` for encounters and rewards
- `zones.js` for floor mapping

## Avoid Project-Specific Lore In Engine Files

Do not add demo lore, region names, character names, or world-specific labels to engine code.

Engine code should stay reusable across different RPG themes.

## Test Checklist Before Commit

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- Run at least one fight.
- Verify XP increases after combat.
- Verify currency changes after rewards and selling.
- Verify loot can be equipped.
- Verify save, export, import, and reset still work.
- Refresh the page and confirm the state reloads.
- Check that visible labels still read like an engine starter, not a one-off game.

## Suggested Branch And Commit Workflow

1. Create a short branch name for the change.
2. Make one focused change set.
3. Test the demo locally.
4. Commit with a clear message that describes the user-facing result.
5. Keep follow-up changes small and separate when possible.
